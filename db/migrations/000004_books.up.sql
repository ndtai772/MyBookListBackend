In such a motion, each point of the curve moves, at any instant, with a normal velocity equal to a function of the curvature at this point. This book is a rigorous and self-contained exposition of the techniques of "motion by curvature". The approach is axiomatic and formulated in terms of geometric invariance with respect to the position of the observer. This is translated into mathematical terms, and the author develops the approach of Olver, Sapiro and Tannenbaum, which classifies all curve evolution equations. He then draws a complete parallel with another axiomatic approach using level-set methods: this leads to generalized curvature motions. Finally, novel, and very accurate, numerical schemes are proposed allowing one to compute the solution of highly degenerate evolution equations in a completely invariant way.

The underlying theory provides a multitude of compression algorithms that encompass two course coding, quad tree coding, hybrid coding and so on. Since the noncausal models provide a fundamentally different image representation, they lead to new approaches to many existing algorithms, including useful approaches for asymmetric, progressive, and adaptive coding techniques. On the theoretical front, the basic result shows that a random field (an ensemble of images) can be coded block by block such that the interblock redundancy can be completely removed while the individual blocks are transform coded. On the practical side, the artifact of tiling, a block boundary effect, present in conventional block by block transform coding techniques has been greatly suppressed. This book contains not only a theoretical discussion of the algorithms but also exhaustive simulation and suggested methodologies for ensemble design techniques. Each of the resulting algorithms has been applied to twelve images over a wide range of image data rates and the results are reported using subjective descriptions, photographs, mathematical MSE values, and h-plots, a recently proposed graphical representation showing a high level of agreement with image quality as judged subjectively.', 1990, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag', 162, '1000/7fa49178389a756b46f455e3822ad6b4.jpg');

Beards', 'Many structures suffer from unwanted vibrations and, although careful analysis at the design stage can minimise these, the vibration levels of many structures are excessive. In this book the entire range of methods of control, both by damping and by excitation, is described in a single volume.  Clear and concise descriptions are given of the techniques for mathematically modelling real structures so that the equations which describe the motion of such structures can be derived. This approach leads to a comprehensive discussion of the analysis of typical models of vibrating structures excited by a range of periodic and random inputs. Careful consideration is also given to the sources of excitation, both internal and external, and the effects of isolation and transmissability. A major part of the book is devoted to damping of structures and many sources of damping are considered, as are the ways of changing damping using both active and passive methods. The numerous worked examples liberally distributed throughout the text, amplify and clarify the theoretical analysis presented. Particular attention is paid to the meaning and interpretation of results, further enhancing the scope and applications of analysis. Over 80 problems are included with answers and worked solutions to most.

It is both a text reference and a textbook that reviews and analyses the research output in this field of binary image processing. It is aimed at both advanced researchers as well as educating the novice to this area. The theoretical part of this book includes the basic principles required for binary digital image analysis. The practical part which will take an algorithmic approach addresses problems which find applications beyond binary digital line image processing. The book first outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the study of digital image processing with particular reference to those needed for line image processing. The theoretical tools in the first part of the book set the stage for the second and third parts, where low-level binary image processing is addressed and then intermediate level processing of binary line images is studied. The book concludes with some practical applications of this work by reviewing some industrial and software applications (engineering drawing storage and primitive extraction, fingerprint compression).

First to be treated are the low-level image-processing issues of noise removaland smoothing while preserving important lines and singularities in an image. At a slightly higher level, a robust contour tracing algorithm is described that produces a cartoon of the important lines in the image. Thirdis the high-level task of reconstructing the geometry of objects in the scene. The book has two aims: to give the computer vision community a new approach to early visual processing, in the form of image segmentation that incorporates occlusion at a low level, and to introduce real computer algorithms that do a better job than what most vision programmers use currently.

A continual control based on sensory feedback is at most necessary at e?ector positions near target locations utilizing torque or haptic sensors. It is desirable to develop new-generation robots showing higher degrees of autonomy for solving high-level deliberate tasks in natural and dynamic en- ronments. Obviously, camera-equipped robot systems, which take and process images and make use of the visual data, can solve more sophisticated robotic tasks. The development of a (semi-) autonomous camera-equipped robot must be grounded on an infrastructure, based on which the system can acquire and/or adapt task-relevant competences autonomously. This infrastructure consists of technical equipment to support the presentation of real world training samples, various learning mechanisms for automatically acquiring function approximations, and testing methods for evaluating the quality of the learned functions. Accordingly, to develop autonomous camera-equipped robot systems one must ?rst demonstrate relevant objects, critical situations, and purposive situation-action pairs in an experimental phase prior to the application phase. Secondly, the learning mechanisms are responsible for - quiring image operators and mechanisms of visual feedback control based on supervised experiences in the task-relevant, real environment. This paradigm of learning-based development leads to the concepts of compatibilities and manifolds. Compatibilities are general constraints on the process of image formation which hold more or less under task-relevant or accidental variations of the imaging conditions.</p>', 2001, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg', 292, '1000/b7408eeb6e37d1065b7d7e91fd14034f-d.jpg');

Jones', '"Neil Jones is one of the precious few computer scientists with great expertise and leadership roles in both formal methods and complexity. This makes his book especially valuable." -- Yuri Gurevich, Professor of Computer Science, University of Michigan
Computability and complexity theory should be of central concern to practitioners as well as theorists. Unfortunately, however, the field is known for its impenetrability. Neil Jones''s goal as an educator and author is to build a bridge between computability and complexity theory and other areas of computer science, especially programming. In a shift away from the Turing machine- and Gödel number-oriented classical approaches, Jones uses concepts familiar from programming languages to make computability and complexity more accessible to computer scientists and more applicable to practical programming problems. According to Jones, the fields of computability and complexity theory, as well as programming languages and semantics, have a great deal to offer each other. Computability and complexity theory have a breadth, depth, and generality not often seen in programming languages. The programming language community, meanwhile, has a firm grasp of algorithm design, presentation, and implementation. In addition, programming languages sometimes provide computational models that are more realistic in certain crucial aspects than traditional models. New results in the book include a proof that constant time factors do matter for its programming-oriented model of computation. (In contrast, Turing machines have a counterintuitive "constant speedup" property: that almost any program can be made to run faster, by any amount. Its proof involves techniques irrelevant to practice.) Further results include simple characterizations in programming terms of the central complexity classes PTIME and LOGSPACE, and a new approach to complete problems for NLOGSPACE, PTIME, NPTIME, and PSPACE, uniformly based on Boolean programs.

The foundations of a new "categorical" combinatory logic are laid down. Compilation and evaluation techniques are investigated. A simple abstract machine, called the Categorical Abstract Machine, is presented: it has served as the core of the implementation of the language CAML, of the ML family, developed at INRIA-Roquencourt and Ecole Normale Superieure, and first released in 1987. The main characteristics of this approach are conceptual simplicity and compactness, with bearings on portability, efficiency, and correctness proofs. A mathematical semantics of sequentiality is proposed, in which "sequential algorithms" rather than functions are used to interpret procedures. The theoretical investigation has led to the development of a programming language, CDSO, in which basic and functional types are not differentiated. The evaluation framework is a demand-driven data flow network.  The model of sequential algorithms is fully abstract with respect to this language: two procedures have the same denotation if and only if they have the same behaviour. Background on full abstraction is given. The new edition covers new results, and introduces new connections, as suggested by the following non-exhaustive fist of keywords: confluence properties of categorical combinators, explicit substitutions, control operations, linear logic, geometry of interaction, strong stability.', 1993, 'English', 'Birkhäuser', 424, '1000/d19a2a7157be645d278710948304e7aa.jpg');

Examining the role of the public intellectual and writer during a time of political conflict and war, Reynolds takes up his charges with great precision and historical finesse. What particularly distinguishes this book is its attention to the ways in which one of this country''s most important authors struggled to resist the waves of political extremism and patriotic hysteria that swept around him."---Jeffrey Steele, University of Wisconsin—Madison Widely condemned even in his own time, Nathaniel Hawthorne''s views on abolitionism and slavery are today frequently characterized by scholars as morally reprehensible. Devils and Rebels explores the historical and biographical record to reveal striking evidence of the author''s true political values---values grounded in pacifism and resistant to the kind of binary thinking that could lead to violence and war. The book offers fresh readings of not only Hawthorne''s four major romances but also some of his less familiar works like "Legends of the Province House," The Whole History of Grandfather''s Chair, Journal of an African Cruiser, The Life of Franklin Pierce, and "Septimius Felton."

By presuming instead no prior knowledge of the text, its versions or its contexts, Mary Orr provides new readings of the seven tableaux which comprise Temptation, and new ways of interpreting the work as a whole, whether the reader is a newcomer to Flaubert or a specialist. Arguing that Flaubert was imagining his own epoch through the eyes of a visionary saint in the fourth century AD, Orr elucidates the dialogues between religion and science that are the dynamic of the work for the first time. She also insists on the meticulous accuracy and imaginative representations of the science of the work, proposing--in the "remapping" analogy of her subtitle--that Flaubert''s Temptation is a paradigm of nineteenth-century French, and indeed European, "literary science." For nineteenth-century French and Flaubert specialists, this book then challenges received critical wisdom on a number of fronts. Through his unlikely protagonist-visionary, Flaubert''s "realism," "anti-clericalism" and "orientalism" are all given new airings in the religious and scientific evidence of the 1874 Temptation, as indeed in his "temptation" to write the life of his times.', 2008, 'English ', 'Oxford University Press', 365, '651000/c99f723bdd7de0bc144553cfde757da7-d.jpg');

Structured like the Standard C Library, it contains 15 headers declaring or defining all of the names in the library. A separate chapter covers each header, including excerpts from relevant portions of the C Standard showing all codes needed to implement each portion of the library and explaining why it is necessary.

Indeed in a small  number of problems GP has evolved programs whose performance is  similar to or even slightly better than that of programs written by  people. The main thrust of GP has been to automatically create  functions. While these can be of great use they contain no memory and  relatively little work has addressed automatic creation of program  code including stored data. This issue is the main focus of Genetic  Programming, and Data Structures: Genetic Programming + Data  Structures = Automatic Programming!.   This book is motivated by the observation from software engineering  that data abstraction (e.g., via abstract data types) is essential in  programs created by human programmers. This book shows that abstract  data types can be similarly beneficial to the automatic production of  programs using GP.   Genetic Programming and Data Structures: Genetic Programming +  Data Structures = Automatic Programming! shows how abstract  data types (stacks, queues and lists) can be evolved using genetic  programming, demonstrates how GP can evolve general programs which  solve the nested brackets problem, recognises a Dyck context free  language, and implements a simple four function calculator.

Darling, who has a Ph.D. in astronomy, has written several books on extraterrestrial life and cosmology. Although this volume offers a single source for comprehensive space flight information, its added value may be limited, as many libraries likely already own biographical resources (such as Michael Cassutt''s Who''s Who in Space), space-mission histories (such as Tim Furniss''s The History of Space Vehicles), and science and technology references (such as the McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology).

Many entries, such as "MECO," are entered under their acronym or initials, but there is no cross reference from the fun form, in this case "Main Engine Cut Off". In addition, entries for scientific terms are often inadequate. For example, "weightlessness" is a mere one paragraph, though one would expect much fuller treatment of such a major aspect of space flight.

Because of this, the majority of the text is devoted to careful derivations of implicit function theorems, methods of averaging, and quasi-static state approximation methods.  The duality between stability and perturbation is developed and used, relying heavily on the concept of stability under persistent disturbances.  This explains why stability and perturbation results developed for quite simple problems are often useful for more complicated, even chaotic, ones. Relevant topics about linear and nonlinear systems, nonlinear oscillations, and stability methods for difference, differential-delay, integro-differential and ordinary and partial differential equations are developed in the book.

The original Russian space stations, he reports, were intended primarily for propaganda and military purposes, but they also included a variety of scientific experiments and perfected the use of unmanned "freighters" to bring supplies and parts from Earth. If readers remember anything about the Russian program, it is probably the troubled final months of the Mir station, but Zimmerman describes the heroic efforts of cosmonauts to put out fires and make extended space walks to undertake complicated repairs. The Russians also conducted extensive research on the effects of living in space on the human body, research that will be invaluable for possible future travel to other planets.

Then use these sensors to build circuits and projects that respond to heat, pressure, light, touch, water, strain, lightning and magnets. You can even make a circuit that detects the presence of the cursor on your computer screen and the position of a compass needle.', 1988, 'English', 'Radio Shack', 52, '1000/d2c50b7be1c6661d2e1b51e2bcce1e4f.jpg');

In a ''black-box'' system, such faults only become   apparent in the output when appropriate inputs are given, which poses a   number of satisfaction and optimisation problems regarding both testing and   diagnosing. In this dissertation we address such problems, developing   models with multi-valued logics that we formalise and generalise to   multiple faults. Such logics extend Boolean logic by encoding dependencies   on faults, thus allowing the modelling of an arbitrary number of diagnostic   theories. The effectiveness of constraint solving over finite domains and   sets is shown on several of the above problems.', 2002, 'English', 'IOS Press', 210, '1000/c115d4dd8b2f9a364f535dd8916894a6.jpg');

The Handbook of Engineering Electromagnetics links theory to specific applications with an integrated approach to areas such as wireless communications, fiber optics, microwaves, radar, materials science, and even biomedical engineering. This book not only provides the necessary formulas, figures, and tables, but also the underlying theory and insight needed to formulate and solve real-world engineering problems. A team of international experts discusses fundamental concepts such as Maxwell equations, static fields, electromagnetic induction, transmission lines, waveguides, and electromagnetic compatibility. They also explore specific technologies, various numerical techniques used for computer-aided solutions, biological effects and safety standards, biomedical applications, and measuring electromagnetic properties of biological materials.

Taguchi’s optimization method is developed based on the orthogonal array (OA) concept, which offers a systematic and efficient way to select design parameters. The book illustrates the basic implementation procedure of Taguchi’s optimization method and discusses various advanced techniques for performance improvement. In addition, the integration of Taguchi’s optimization method with commercial electromagnetics software is introduced in the book. The proposed optimization method is used in various linear antenna arrays, microstrip filters, and ultra-wideband antenna designs. Successful examples include linear antenna array with a null controlled pattern, linear antenna array with a sector beam, linear antenna array with reduced side lobe levels, microstrip band stop filter, microstrip band pass filter, coplanar waveguide band stop filter, coplanar ultra-wide band antenna, and ultra-wide band antenna with band notch feature.

In this dramatic and moving biography, Sylvia Nasar re-creates the life of a mathematical genius whose brilliant career was cut short by schizophrenia and who, after three decades of devastating mental illness, miraculously recovered and was honored with a Nobel Prize. A Beautiful Mind traces the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash, Jr., from his lonely childhood in West Virginia to his student years at Princeton, where he encountered Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, and a host of other mathematical luminaries. At twenty-one, the handsome, ambitious, eccentric graduate student invented what would become the most influential theory of rational human behavior in modern social science. Nash''s contribution to game theory would ultimately revolutionize the field of economics. As a young professor at MIT, still in his twenties, Nash dazzled the mathematical world by solving a series of deep problems deemed "impossible" by other mathematicians. As unconventional in his private life as in his mathematics, Nash fathered a child with a woman he did not marry. At the height of the McCarthy era, he was expelled as a security risk from the supersecret RAND Corporation -- the Cold War think tank where he was a consultant. At thirty, Nash was poised to take his dreamed-of place in the pantheon of history''s greatest mathematicians. His associates included the most renowned mathematicians and economists of the era: Norbert Wiener, John Milnor, Alexandre Grothendieck, Kenneth Arrow, Robert Solow, and Paul Samuelson. He married an exotic and beautiful MIT physics student, Alicia Larde. They had a son. Then Nash suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown. Nasar details Nash''s harrowing descent into insanity -- his bizarre delusions that he was the Prince of Peace; his resignation from MIT, flight to Europe, and attempt to renounce his American citizenship; his repeated hospitalizations, from the storied McLean, where he came to know the poet Robert Lowell, to t', 2000, 'English', '', 127, '882000/9f74302335b5049d4c6a02900c1532b0-g.jpg');

There are many reasons why it should be written. First, the theory of transversely isotropic elastic materials is an important branch of applied mathematics and engineering science; but because of the difficulties caused by anisotropy, the mathematical treatments and descriptions of individual problems have been scattered throughout the technical literature. This often hinders further development and applications. Hence, a text that can present the theory and solution methodology uniformly is necessary. Secondly, with the rapid development of modern technologies, the theory of transversely isotropic elasticity has become increasingly important. In addition to the fields with which the theory has traditionally been associated, such as civil engineering and materials engineering, many emerging technologies have demanded the development of transversely isotropic elasticity. Some immediate examples are thin film technology, piezoelectric technology, functionally gradient materials technology and those involving transversely isotropic and layered microstructures, such as multi-layer systems and tribology mechanics of magnetic recording devices. Thus a unified mathematical treatment and presentation of solution methods for a wide range of mechanics models are of primary importance to both technological and economic progress.</p>', 2006, 'English', 'Springer Netherlands', 435, '2000/2A77DDC881ACACDBEEE860F288CE6A68-d.jpg');

Doyle', 'All structures suffer from stresses and strains caused by factors such as wind loading and vibrations. Stress analysis and measurement is an integral part of the design and management of structures, and is used in a wide range of engineering areas. There are two main types of stress analyses - the first is conceptual where the structure does not yet exist and the analyst has more freedom to define geometry, materials, loads etc - generally such analysis is undertaken using numerical methods such as the finite element method. The second is where the structure (or a prototype) exists, and so some parameters are known. Others though, such as wind loading or environmental conditions will not be completely known and yet may profoundly affect the structure. These problems are generally handled by an ad hoc combination of experimental and analytical methods. This book therefore tackles one of the most common challenges facing engineers - how to solve a stress analysis problem when all of the required information is not available. Its central concern is to establish formal methods for including measurements as part of the complete analysis of such problems by presenting a new approach to the processing of experimental data and thus to experimentation itself. In addition, engineers using finite element methods will be able to extend the range of problems they can solve (and thereby the range of applications they can address) using the methods developed here.', 2004, 'English', 'Wiley', 435, '2000/0a8f1a16266f5a71be1b166eda5901eb-d.jpg');

It is expedient, to make thin­ walled composite rods, plates, and shells from such materials. Plates can be made by bonding a set of unidirectional thin fiber layers, Fig.l.l. Such plates are orthotropic, as a rule. A random short-fiber composite is shown in Fig. 1.2. Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used in thin-walled aircraft structures because of their specific high strength. For example, the graphite-epoxy composite is characterized by a unidirectional tensile strength of 1.4 GPa while the density is 1.6 Mg/rrt? .

For the first 25 years or so of its existence, information theory served as a rich source of academic research problems and as a tantalizing suggestion that communication systems could be made more efficient and more reliable by using these approaches. Other than small experiments and a few highly specialized military systems, the theory had little interaction with practice. By the mid 1970’s, however, mainstream systems using information-theoretic ideas began to be widely implemented. The first reason for this was the increasing number of engineers who understood both information theory and communication system practice. The second reason was that the low cost and increasing processing power of digital hardware made it possible to implement the sophisticated algorithms suggested by information theory. The third reason was that the increasing complexity of communication systems required the architectural principles of information theory.', 1985, 'English', 'Elsevier Science Ltd', 286, '2000/c2d2da86570bbfa765f53ba7ee133a85.jpg');

Wherever light is used to transmit information, tiny semiconductor devices are needed to transfer electrical current into optical signals  and vice versa. Examples include light emitting diodes in radios and other appliances, photodetectors in elevator doors and digital cameras, and laser diodes that transmit phone calls through glass fibers. Such optoelectronic devices take advantage of sophisticated interactions between electrons and light.  Nanometer scale semiconductor structures are often at the heart of modern optoelectronic devices. Their shrinking size and increasing complexity make  computer simulation an important tool to design better devices that meet  ever rising perfomance requirements. The current need to apply advanced design software in optoelectronics follows the trend observed in the 1980''s with simulation software for silicon devices.  Today, software for technology computer-aided design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) represents a fundamental part of the silicon industry. In optoelectronics, advanced commercial device software has emerged recently and it is expected to play an increasingly important role in the near future. This book will enable students, device engineers, and researchers to more effectively use advanced design software in optoelectronics.                                         *  Provides fundamental knowledge in semiconductor physics and in electromagnetics, while helping to understand and use advanced device simulation software  *  Demonstrates the combination of measurements and simulations in order to obtain realistic results and provides data on all required material parameters  *  Gives deep insight into the physics of state-of-the-art devices and helps to design and analyze of modern optoelectronic devices', 2003, 'English', 'Academic Press', 296, '2000/f4c3ef22e9b1d8edb031ead05d8f3dcd-d.jpg');

Situated within a strong conceptual framework and drawing from a rich empirical base, it reflects recent scholarship in applied linguistics that has begun to move away from formalist views of language as universal, autonomous linguistic systems, and toward an understanding of language as dynamic collections of cultural resources. According to Bakhtin, the study of language is concerned with the  dialogue  existing between linguistic elements and the uses to which they are put in response to the conditions of the moment. Such a view of language has significant implications for current understandings of second- and foreign-language learning.  The contributors draw on some of Bakhtin''s more significant concepts, such as dialogue, utterance, heteroglossia, voice, and addressivity to examine real world contexts of language learning. The chapters address a range of contexts including elementary- and university-level English as a second language and foreign language classrooms and adult learning situations outside the formal classroom. The text is arranged in two parts. Part I, "Contexts of Language Learning and Teaching," contains seven chapters that report on investigations into specific contexts of language learning and teaching. The chapters in Part II, "Implications for Theory and Practice," present broader discussions on second and foreign language learning using Bakhtin''s ideas as a springboard for thinking.  This is a groundbreaking volume for scholars in applied linguistics, language education, and language studies with an interest in second and foreign language learning; for teacher educators; and for teachers of languages from elementary to university levels.

Given the convergence of computing and communications, the book also effectively is a computer dictionary with a telecom focus. It is thoroughly researched, highly objective, absolutely accurate, and includes just about every essential term, abbreviation, acronym, contraction, initialism, and portmanteau you might encounter in the telecom and datacom domains.

In fact, many entries are encyclopedic in nature, discussing applications and issues. Horak also injects a bit of his wry sense of humor, sprinkling occasional telecom trivia and marginally related definitions that will have you smiling and chuckling to yourself, but not to the point that they detract from what is an important book on a serious subject.

In keeping with technological innovations, it discusses computer-based projections and slide shows as well as overhead projections. In particular, it discusses ways of organizing graphics and text in projected images and of using layout and design to present the information efficiently and effectively.Unlike other books that discuss technical presentations, this book anchors its advice in the experiences of scientists and engineers, including such successful presenters as Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, as well as currently active laboratory directors, scientists, and engineers. In addition to examining successful presentations, Alley also discusses the errors that cause many scientific presentations to flounder, providing a list of ten critical errors to avoid.

The academic community has recently recognized how important it  is for writers to become more sophisticated, knowledgeable, and skeptical about what the write. More than 50 institutions now offer training in science writing. In addition mid-career fellowships for science writers are growing, giving journalists the chance to return to major universities for specialized training. We applaud these developments, and hope to be part of them with this new edition of the Field Guide.

Birch', 'This book is a comprehensive, myth-debunking examination of how L1 features (orthographic system, phonology, morphology) can influence English L2 reading at the "bottom" of the reading process. It provides a thorough but very accessible linguistic/psycholinguistic examination of the lowest levels of the reading process. It is both theoretical and practical.Although the methodologies and approaches taken in most ESL/EFL texts about reading are top-down (cognition driven), and pay scant attention to the bottom of the reading process, those detailed in this book are language driven. The goal is to balance or supplement (not replace) top-down approaches and methodologies with effective low-level options for teaching English reading. Core linguistic and psycholinguistic concepts are presented within the context of their application to teaching.English L2 Reading: Getting to the Bottom clearly explains the strategies that readers of other languages develop in response to their own writing systems (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, other alphabets, or transparent Roman alphabetic systems) contrasted with an explanation of the strategies that English readers develop in response to the opaque orthography of English, and explicates how other low-level processing strategies for L1 morphology and word formation may aid or hinder processing in English L2 reading acquisition.A complete, balanced reading ideology should be big enough to embrace all reading theories and practices. In particular, it should be able to accommodate those researchers and teachers who find that attention to the details of language can also help students learn to read better. Many ESL/EFLteachers are interested in supplementing their successful whole-language methods with bottom-up reading strategies, but aren''t sure how to do it. This book fills that gap.Intended for ESL/EFL reading researchers, teacher trainers and teachers, and as a text for MATESOL students, most chapters contain practical suggestions that teachers can incorporate into whole lang', 2002, 'English', 'Routledge', 213, '2000/ffecb959a8c88b4db33c0e7c6e481f4a-d.jpg');

It has become increasingly clear, however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes categories as distributions and views knowledge of language not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena, probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground. Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective.    This book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial on elementary probability theory and probabilistic grammars.', 2003, 'English', 'MIT Press', 464, '2000/6b5dd2de2ce943d56e14712b495ab266-d.jpg');

Over the past fifty years, this framework has sparked an explosion of inquiry into a wide range of languages, and has yielded some major theoretical questions.

The fundamental issue it addresses is the proper balance between syntax and semantics, between structure and derivation, and between rule systems and lexicon. It argues that the balance struck by mainstream generative grammar is wrong. It puts forward a new basis for syntactic theory, drawing on a wide range of frameworks, and charts new directions for research.  In the past four decades, theories of syntactic structure have become more abstract, and syntactic derivations have become ever more complex. Peter Culicover and Ray Jackendoff trace this development through the history of contemporary syntactic theory, showing how much it has been driven by theory-internal rather than empirical considerations. They develop an alternative that is responsive to linguistic, cognitive, computational, and biological concerns.  Simpler Syntax is addressed to linguists of all persuasions.

This further implies that in their applied linguistics, applied linguists take account of a wider range of interests and disciplines than do linguists who are primarily concerned with the development and validation of linguistic theories.

Christopher Gauker rejects this conception of language, arguing that it rests on an untenable conception of mental representation and yields a wrong account of the norms of discourse.    Gauker''s alternative starts with the observation that conversations have goals and that the best way to achieve the goal of a conversation depends on the circumstances under which the conversation takes place. These goals and circumstances determine a  context of utterance  quite apart from the attitudes of the interlocutors. The fundamental norms of discourse are formulated in terms of the conditions under which sentences are assertible in such contexts.

In attempting to present some of Montague''s insights in an elementary way (hopefully avoid­ ing the notation which many find difficult at first), the authors began dis­ cussions aimed towards the construction of a simple model-theoretical semantic apparatus which could be applied directly to a small English-like language and used to illustrate the methods of formal logical interpretation. In these discussions two points impressed themselves on us. First, our task could be simplified by using boolean algebras and boolean homomorphisms in the models; and second, the boolean approach we were developing had much more widespread relevance to the logical structure of English than we first thought. During the summer and fall of 1978 we continued work on the system, proving the more fundamental theorems (including what we have come to call the Justification Theorem) and outlining the way in which an intensional interpretation scheme could be developed which made use of the boolean approach (which was originally strictly extensional). We presented our findings in a monograph (Keenan and Faltz, 1978) which the UCLA Linguistics Department kindly published as part of their series called Occa­ sional Papers in Linguistics; one of the authors also presented the system at a colloquium held at the Winter Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America in December 1978.</p>', 1984, 'English', 'Springer Netherlands', 387, '2000/c25e29fd92fc67e4a03670191e0e2d38-d.jpg');

Now, Let''s Learn Kanji goes to the heart of the problem: the learning of kanji (i.e., Chinese characters as they are used in Japan).Not simply a brilliant exposition but also a workbook, it teaches the student how to write the basic strokes, how to put these together into full-fledged kanji, and how kanji function in the context of example sentences.

The Berezin integral is named for him, as is the closely related construction of the Berezinian, which may be regarded as the superanalog of the determinant. This book features a masterfully written memoir by Berezin''s widow, Elena Karpel, who narrates a remarkable account of Berezin''s life and his struggle for survival under the totalitarian Soviet regime.

Carefully developing the foundations of the subject, the authors begin by providing background on the terminology and introducing the different module classes. The modules classes consist of torsion, torsion-free, s[M], natural, and prenatural. They expand the discussion by exploring advanced theorems and new classes, such as new chain conditions, TS-module theory, and the lattice of prenatural classes of right R-modules, which contains many of the previously used lattices of module classes.

One of its first important problems was partially solved by Dushnik, Miller 1940 who, starting from the chain of reals, obtained an infinite strictly decreasing sequence of chains (of continuum power) with respect to embeddability.  In 1948 I conjectured that every strictly decreasing sequence of denumerable chains is finite.  This was affirmatively proved by Laver (1968), in the more general case of denumerable unions of scattered chains (ie: which do not embed the chain Q of rationals), by using the barrier and the better orderin gof Nash-Williams (1965 to 68).  Another important problem is the extension to posets of classical properties of chains.  For instance one easily sees that a chain A is scattered if the chain of inclusion of its initial intervals is itself scattered (6.1.4).  Let us again define a scattered poset A by the non-embedding of Q in A.  We say that A is finitely free if every antichain restriction of A is finite (antichain = set of mutually incomparable elements of the base). In 1969 Bonnet and Pouzet proved that a poset A is finitely free and scattered iff the ordering of inclusion of initial intervals of A is scattered.  In 1981 Pouzet proved the equivalence with the a priori stronger condition that A is topologically scattered: (see 6.7.4; a more general result is due to Mislove 1984); ie: every non-empty set of initial intervals contains an isolated elements for the simple convergence topology.  In chapter 9 we begin the general theory of relations, with the notions of local isomorphism, free interpretability and free operator (9.1 to 9.3), which is the relationist version of a free logical formula.  This is generalized by the back-and-forth notions in 10.10: the (k,p)-operator is the relationist version of the elementary formula (first order formula with equality).

The answer is simple: I did not learn about it until it was too late! My writing project in ring theory started in 1983 after I taught a year-long course in the subject at Berkeley. My original plan was to write up my lectures and publish them as a graduate text in a couple of years. My hopes of carrying out this plan on schedule were, however, quickly dashed as I began to realize how much material was at hand and how little time I had at my disposal. As the years went by, I added further material to my notes, and used them to teach different versions of the course. Eventually, I came to the realization that writing a single volume would not fully accomplish my original goal of giving a comprehensive treatment of basic ring theory. At the suggestion of Ulrike Schmickler-Hirzebruch, then Mathematics Editor of Springer-Verlag, I completed the first part of my project and published the write­ up in 1991 as A First Course in Noncommutative Rings, GTM 131, hereafter referred to as First Course (or simply FC).</p>', 1999, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag New York', 557, '3000/26e3dcccddeabf8f526ed58e93d059d3-d.jpg');

This book is an outgrowth of my lectures in these two courses, and is intended for use by instructors and graduate students in a similar one-semester course in basic ring theory. Ring theory is a subject of central importance in algebra. Historically, some of the major discoveries in ring theory have helped shape the course of development of modern abstract algebra. Today, ring theory is a fer­ tile meeting ground for group theory (group rings), representation theory (modules), functional analysis (operator algebras), Lie theory (enveloping algebras), algebraic geometry (finitely generated algebras, differential op­ erators, invariant theory), arithmetic (orders, Brauer groups), universal algebra (varieties of rings), and homological algebra (cohomology of rings, projective modules, Grothendieck and higher K-groups). In view of these basic connections between ring theory and other branches of mathemat­ ics, it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that a course in ring theory is an indispensable part of the education for any fledgling algebraist.

He recognized that power series expansions can serve to clarify properties of systems of congruences which frequently occur in the allied theories of algebraic numbers and algebraic functions. In his book Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen he stated in 1908 the famous Reducibility Lemma on which a major part of the work on valuations is based. Thus, a powerful tool, already known to Newton in the discussion of plane curves, became available to algebra proper.

Permutations can be decomposed into cycles, polynomials over a finite field into irreducible factors, mappings into connected components. In all of these examples, and in many more, there are strong similarities between the numbers of components of different sizes that are found in the decompositions of "typical" elements of large size. For instance, the total number of components grows logarithmically with the size of the element, and the size of the largest component is an appreciable fraction of the whole.    This book explains the similarities in asymptotic behavior as the result of two basic properties shared by the structures: the conditioning relation and the logarithmic condition. The discussion is conducted in the language of probability, enabling the theory to be developed under rather general and explicit conditions; for the finer conclusions, Stein''s method emerges as the key ingredient.

The second, on multiplicative number systems, demonstrates the challenge and reward of becoming reasonably comfortable with Dirichlet series.Book News, Inc.R, Portland, ORProduct Description:This book shows how a study of generating series (power series in the additive case and Dirichlet series in the multiplicative case), combined with structure theorems for the finite models of a sentence, lead to general and powerful results on limit laws, including $0 - 1$ laws. The book is unique in its approach to giving a combined treatment of topics from additive as well as from multiplicative number theory, in the setting of abstract number systems, emphasizing the remarkable parallels in the two subjects. Much evidence is collected to support the thesis that local results in additive systems lift to global results in multiplicative systems. All necessary material is given to understand thoroughly the method of Compton for proving logical limit laws, including a full treatment of Ehrenfeucht-Fraissé games, the Feferman-Vaught Theorem, and Skolem''s quantifier elimination for finite Boolean algebras.

A substantial proportion of the book covers topics that have not appeared in book form before, and as such it provides an accessible introduction to the research literature and to important open questions in modern algebraic graph theory. This book is primarily aimed at graduate students and researchers in graph theory, combinatorics, or discrete mathematics in general. However, all the necessary graph theory is developed from scratch, so the only pre-requisite for reading it is a first course in linear algebra and a small amount of elementary group theory. It should be accessible to motivated upper-level undergraduates. Chris Godsil is a full professor in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo. His main research interests lie in the interactions between algebra and combinatorics, in particular the application of algebraic techniques to graphs, designs and codes. He has published more than 70 papers in these areas, is a founding editor of "The Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics" and is the author of the book "Algebraic Combinatorics".

The theory is also intimately related to many branches of mathematics, including group theory, matrix theory, numerical analysis, probability, topology, and combinatorics. The fact is that graph theory serves as a mathematical model for any system involving a binary relation.

Combinatorics is one of the branches of mathematics that play a crucial role in computer sCience, since digital computers manipulate discrete, finite objects. Combinatorics impinges on computing in two ways. First, the properties of graphs and other combinatorial objects lead directly to algorithms for solving graph-theoretic problems, which have widespread application in non-numerical as well as in numerical computing. Second, combinatorial methods provide many analytical tools that can be used for determining the worst-case and expected performance of computer algorithms. A knowledge of combinatorics will serve the computer scientist well. Combinatorics can be classified into three types: enumerative, eXistential, and constructive. Enumerative combinatorics deals with the counting of combinatorial objects.

This collection of Kolchin''s clear and comprehensive papers--in themselves constituting a history of the subject--is an invaluable aid to the student of differential algebra. In 1910, Ritt created a theory of algebraic differential equations modeled not on the existing transcendental methods of Lie, but rather on the new algebra being developed by E. Noether and B. van der Waerden. Building on Ritt''s foundation, and deeply influenced by Weil and Chevalley, Kolchin opened up Ritt theory to modern algebraic geometry. In so doing, he led differential geometry in a new direction. By creating differential algebraic geometry and the theory of differential algebraic groups, Kolchin provided the foundation for a ``new geometry'''' that has led to both a striking and an original approach to arithmetic algebraic geometry. Intriguing possibilities were introduced for a new language for nonlinear differential equations theory. The volume includes commentary by A. Borel, M. Singer, and B. Poizat.

Goldschmidt, P. A. Griffiths (auth.)', '<p>This book gives a treatment of exterior differential systems. It will in­ clude both the general theory and various applications. An exterior differential system is a system of equations on a manifold defined by equating to zero a number of exterior differential forms. When all the forms are linear, it is called a pfaffian system. Our object is to study its integral manifolds, i. e. , submanifolds satisfying all the equations of the system. A fundamental fact is that every equation implies the one obtained by exterior differentiation, so that the complete set of equations associated to an exterior differential system constitutes a differential ideal in the algebra of all smooth forms. Thus the theory is coordinate-free and computations typically have an algebraic character; however, even when coordinates are used in intermediate steps, the use of exterior algebra helps to efficiently guide the computations, and as a consequence the treatment adapts well to geometrical and physical problems. A system of partial differential equations, with any number of inde­ pendent and dependent variables and involving partial derivatives of any order, can be written as an exterior differential system.

In much the same way that ordinary Galois theory is the theory of field extensions generated by solutions of (one variable) polynomial equations, differential Galois theory looks at the nature of the differential field extension generated by the solutions of differential equations. An additional feature is that the corresponding differential Galois groups (of automorphisms of the extension fixing the base and commuting with the derivation) are algebraic groups. This book deals with the differential Galois theory of linear homogeneous differential equations, whose differential Galois groups are algebraic matrix groups. In addition to providing a convenient path to Galois theory, this approach also leads to the constructive solution of the inverse problem of differential Galois theory for various classes of algebraic groups.

Morales Ruiz', 'This book is devoted to the relation between two different concepts of integrability: the complete integrability of complex analytical Hamiltonian systems and the integrability of complex analytical linear differential equations. For linear differential equations, integrability is made precise within the framework of differential Galois theory. The connection of these two integrability notions is given by the variational equation (i.e. linearized equation) along a particular integral curve of the Hamiltonian system. The underlying heuristic idea, which motivated the main results presented in this monograph, is that a necessary condition for the integrability of a Hamiltonian system is the integrability of the variational equation along any of its particular integral curves. This idea led to the algebraic non-integrability criteria for Hamiltonian systems. These criteria can be considered as generalizations of classical non-integrability results by Poincaré and Liapunov, as well as more recent results by Ziglin and Yoshida. Thus, by means of the differential Galois theory it is not only possible to understand all these approaches in a unified way but also to improve them. Several important applications are also included: homogeneous potentials, Bianchi IX cosmological model, three-body problem, Hénon-Heiles system, etc.The book is based on the original joint research of the author with J.M. Peris, J.P. Ramis and C. Simó, but an effort was made to present these achievements in their logical order rather than their historical one.

A logarithmic point of view is taken, marking the exceptional divisor of each blowing-up and by considering only the vector fields which are tangent to this divisor, instead of the whole tangent sheaf. The first part of the book is devoted to the logarithmic background and to the permissible blowing-ups. The main part corresponds to the control of the algorithms for the desingularization strategies by means of numerical invariants inspired by Hironaka''s characteristic polygon. Only basic knowledge of local algebra and algebraic geometry is assumed of the reader.

It became increasingly important that vertex algebras are useful not only in the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, where they are by now ubiquitous, but also in other fields, such as algebraic geometry, theory of finite groups, modular functions, and topology. This book is an introduction to the theory of vertex algebras with a particular emphasis on the relationship between vertex algebras and the geometry of moduli spaces of algebraic curves. The authors make the first steps toward reformulating the theory of vertex algebras in a way that is suitable for algebraic-geometric applications. The notion of a vertex algebra is introduced in the book in a co-ordinate independent way, allowing the authors to give global geometric meaning to vertex operators on arbitrary smooth algebraic curves, possibly equipped with some additional data. To each vertex algebra and a smooth curve, they attach an invariant called the space of conformal blocks.  When the complex structure of the curve and other geometric data are varied, these spaces combine into a sheaf on the relevant moduli space. From this perspective, vertex algebras appear as the algebraic objects that encode the geometric structure of various moduli spaces associated with algebraic curves. Numerous examples and applications of vertex algebras are included, such as the Wakimoto realization of affine Kac-Moody algebras, integral solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, classical and quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions, and the $W$-algebras. The authors also establish a connection between vertex algebras and chiral algebras, introduced by A. Beilinson and V.

Similarly, ruled and elliptic surfaces are discussed in detail, and then the geometry of vector bundles over such surfaces is analyzed.

The simplest and most interesting of these is the moment polytope, a convex polyhedron which sits inside the dual of the Lie algebra of G. One of the main goals of this monograph is to describe what kinds of geometric information are encoded in this polytope. The moment polytope also encodes quantum information about the action of G. Using the methods of geometric quantization, one can frequently convert this action into a representation, p, of G on a Hilbert space, and in some sense the moment polytope is a diagramatic picture of the irreducible representations of G which occur as subrepresentations of p. Precise versions of this item of folklore are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Also, midway through Chapter 2 a more complicated object is discussed: the Duistermaat-Heckman measure, and the author explains in Chapter 4 how one can read off from this measure the approximate multiplicities with which the irreducible representations of G occur in p.

Algebraic geometry has developed tremendously over the last century. During the 19th century, the subject was practiced on a relatively concrete, down-to-earth level; the main objects of study were projective varieties, and the techniques for the most part were grounded in geometric constructions. This approach flourished during the middle of the century and reached its culmination in the work of the Italian school around the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries.

He then draws a complete parallel with another axiomatic approach using level-set methods: this leads to generalized curvature motions. Finally, novel, and very accurate, numerical schemes are proposed allowing one to compute the solution of highly degenerate evolution equations in a completely invariant way.

The underlying theory provides a multitude of compression algorithms that encompass two course coding, quad tree coding, hybrid coding and so on. Since the noncausal models provide a fundamentally different image representation, they lead to new approaches to many existing algorithms, including useful approaches for asymmetric, progressive, and adaptive coding techniques. On the theoretical front, the basic result shows that a random field (an ensemble of images) can be coded block by block such that the interblock redundancy can be completely removed while the individual blocks are transform coded. On the practical side, the artifact of tiling, a block boundary effect, present in conventional block by block transform coding techniques has been greatly suppressed. This book contains not only a theoretical discussion of the algorithms but also exhaustive simulation and suggested methodologies for ensemble design techniques. Each of the resulting algorithms has been applied to twelve images over a wide range of image data rates and the results are reported using subjective descriptions, photographs, mathematical MSE values, and h-plots, a recently proposed graphical representation showing a high level of agreement with image quality as judged subjectively.', 1990, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag', 162, '1000/7fa49178389a756b46f455e3822ad6b4.jpg');

Beards', 'Many structures suffer from unwanted vibrations and, although careful analysis at the design stage can minimise these, the vibration levels of many structures are excessive. In this book the entire range of methods of control, both by damping and by excitation, is described in a single volume.  Clear and concise descriptions are given of the techniques for mathematically modelling real structures so that the equations which describe the motion of such structures can be derived. This approach leads to a comprehensive discussion of the analysis of typical models of vibrating structures excited by a range of periodic and random inputs. Careful consideration is also given to the sources of excitation, both internal and external, and the effects of isolation and transmissability. A major part of the book is devoted to damping of structures and many sources of damping are considered, as are the ways of changing damping using both active and passive methods. The numerous worked examples liberally distributed throughout the text, amplify and clarify the theoretical analysis presented. Particular attention is paid to the meaning and interpretation of results, further enhancing the scope and applications of analysis. Over 80 problems are included with answers and worked solutions to most. This book provides engineering students, designers and professional engineers with a detailed insight into the principles involved in the analysis and damping of structural vibration while presenting a sound theoretical basis for further study.

This book addresses the process at several levels. First to be treated are the low-level image-processing issues of noise removaland smoothing while preserving important lines and singularities in an image. At a slightly higher level, a robust contour tracing algorithm is described that produces a cartoon of the important lines in the image. Thirdis the high-level task of reconstructing the geometry of objects in the scene. The book has two aims: to give the computer vision community a new approach to early visual processing, in the form of image segmentation that incorporates occlusion at a low level, and to introduce real computer algorithms that do a better job than what most vision programmers use currently. The algorithms are: - a nonlinear filter that reduces noise and enhances edges, - an edge detector that also finds corners and produces smoothed contours rather than bitmaps, - an algorithm for filling gaps in contours.</p>', 1993, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg', 152, '1000/7bec16add82336b72fbd6db17811940a-d.jpg');

A continual control based on sensory feedback is at most necessary at e?ector positions near target locations utilizing torque or haptic sensors. It is desirable to develop new-generation robots showing higher degrees of autonomy for solving high-level deliberate tasks in natural and dynamic en- ronments. Obviously, camera-equipped robot systems, which take and process images and make use of the visual data, can solve more sophisticated robotic tasks. The development of a (semi-) autonomous camera-equipped robot must be grounded on an infrastructure, based on which the system can acquire and/or adapt task-relevant competences autonomously. This infrastructure consists of technical equipment to support the presentation of real world training samples, various learning mechanisms for automatically acquiring function approximations, and testing methods for evaluating the quality of the learned functions. Accordingly, to develop autonomous camera-equipped robot systems one must ?rst demonstrate relevant objects, critical situations, and purposive situation-action pairs in an experimental phase prior to the application phase. Secondly, the learning mechanisms are responsible for - quiring image operators and mechanisms of visual feedback control based on supervised experiences in the task-relevant, real environment. This paradigm of learning-based development leads to the concepts of compatibilities and manifolds. Compatibilities are general constraints on the process of image formation which hold more or less under task-relevant or accidental variations of the imaging conditions.</p>', 2001, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg', 292, '1000/b7408eeb6e37d1065b7d7e91fd14034f-d.jpg');

Jones', '"Neil Jones is one of the precious few computer scientists with great expertise and leadership roles in both formal methods and complexity. This makes his book especially valuable." -- Yuri Gurevich, Professor of Computer Science, University of Michigan
Computability and complexity theory should be of central concern to practitioners as well as theorists. Unfortunately, however, the field is known for its impenetrability. Neil Jones''s goal as an educator and author is to build a bridge between computability and complexity theory and other areas of computer science, especially programming. In a shift away from the Turing machine- and Gödel number-oriented classical approaches, Jones uses concepts familiar from programming languages to make computability and complexity more accessible to computer scientists and more applicable to practical programming problems. According to Jones, the fields of computability and complexity theory, as well as programming languages and semantics, have a great deal to offer each other. Computability and complexity theory have a breadth, depth, and generality not often seen in programming languages. The programming language community, meanwhile, has a firm grasp of algorithm design, presentation, and implementation. In addition, programming languages sometimes provide computational models that are more realistic in certain crucial aspects than traditional models. New results in the book include a proof that constant time factors do matter for its programming-oriented model of computation. (In contrast, Turing machines have a counterintuitive "constant speedup" property: that almost any program can be made to run faster, by any amount. Its proof involves techniques irrelevant to practice.) Further results include simple characterizations in programming terms of the central complexity classes PTIME and LOGSPACE, and a new approach to complete problems for NLOGSPACE, PTIME, NPTIME, and PSPACE, uniformly based on Boolean programs.

The foundations of a new "categorical" combinatory logic are laid down. Compilation and evaluation techniques are investigated. A simple abstract machine, called the Categorical Abstract Machine, is presented: it has served as the core of the implementation of the language CAML, of the ML family, developed at INRIA-Roquencourt and Ecole Normale Superieure, and first released in 1987. The main characteristics of this approach are conceptual simplicity and compactness, with bearings on portability, efficiency, and correctness proofs. A mathematical semantics of sequentiality is proposed, in which "sequential algorithms" rather than functions are used to interpret procedures. The theoretical investigation has led to the development of a programming language, CDSO, in which basic and functional types are not differentiated. The evaluation framework is a demand-driven data flow network.  The model of sequential algorithms is fully abstract with respect to this language: two procedures have the same denotation if and only if they have the same behaviour. Background on full abstraction is given. The new edition covers new results, and introduces new connections, as suggested by the following non-exhaustive fist of keywords: confluence properties of categorical combinators, explicit substitutions, control operations, linear logic, geometry of interaction, strong stability.', 1993, 'English', 'Birkhäuser', 424, '1000/d19a2a7157be645d278710948304e7aa.jpg');

Examining the role of the public intellectual and writer during a time of political conflict and war, Reynolds takes up his charges with great precision and historical finesse. What particularly distinguishes this book is its attention to the ways in which one of this country''s most important authors struggled to resist the waves of political extremism and patriotic hysteria that swept around him."---Jeffrey Steele, University of Wisconsin—Madison Widely condemned even in his own time, Nathaniel Hawthorne''s views on abolitionism and slavery are today frequently characterized by scholars as morally reprehensible. Devils and Rebels explores the historical and biographical record to reveal striking evidence of the author''s true political values---values grounded in pacifism and resistant to the kind of binary thinking that could lead to violence and war. The book offers fresh readings of not only Hawthorne''s four major romances but also some of his less familiar works like "Legends of the Province House," The Whole History of Grandfather''s Chair, Journal of an African Cruiser, The Life of Franklin Pierce, and "Septimius Felton." Reynolds argues that Hawthorne---whether in his politics or his art---drew upon racialized imagery from America''s past revolution and war on witchcraft to create a politics of quiet imagination, alert to the ways in which New England righteousness could become totalitarian by imposing its narrow view of the world on others.

By presuming instead no prior knowledge of the text, its versions or its contexts, Mary Orr provides new readings of the seven tableaux which comprise Temptation, and new ways of interpreting the work as a whole, whether the reader is a newcomer to Flaubert or a specialist. Arguing that Flaubert was imagining his own epoch through the eyes of a visionary saint in the fourth century AD, Orr elucidates the dialogues between religion and science that are the dynamic of the work for the first time. She also insists on the meticulous accuracy and imaginative representations of the science of the work, proposing--in the "remapping" analogy of her subtitle--that Flaubert''s Temptation is a paradigm of nineteenth-century French, and indeed European, "literary science." For nineteenth-century French and Flaubert specialists, this book then challenges received critical wisdom on a number of fronts. Through his unlikely protagonist-visionary, Flaubert''s "realism," "anti-clericalism" and "orientalism" are all given new airings in the religious and scientific evidence of the 1874 Temptation, as indeed in his "temptation" to write the life of his times.', 2008, 'English ', 'Oxford University Press', 365, '651000/c99f723bdd7de0bc144553cfde757da7-d.jpg');

Recently genetic programming (GP) has started to  show its promise by automatically evolving programs. Indeed in a small  number of problems GP has evolved programs whose performance is  similar to or even slightly better than that of programs written by  people. The main thrust of GP has been to automatically create  functions. While these can be of great use they contain no memory and  relatively little work has addressed automatic creation of program  code including stored data. This issue is the main focus of Genetic  Programming, and Data Structures: Genetic Programming + Data  Structures = Automatic Programming!.   This book is motivated by the observation from software engineering  that data abstraction (e.g., via abstract data types) is essential in  programs created by human programmers. This book shows that abstract  data types can be similarly beneficial to the automatic production of  programs using GP.   Genetic Programming and Data Structures: Genetic Programming +  Data Structures = Automatic Programming! shows how abstract  data types (stacks, queues and lists) can be evolved using genetic  programming, demonstrates how GP can evolve general programs which  solve the nested brackets problem, recognises a Dyck context free  language, and implements a simple four function calculator. In these  cases, an appropriate data structure is beneficial compared to simple  indexed memory. This book also includes a survey of GP, with a  critical review of experiments with evolving memory, and reports  investigations of real world electrical network maintenance scheduling  problems that demonstrate that Genetic Algorithms can find low cost  viable solutions to such problems.

Darling, who has a Ph.D. in astronomy, has written several books on extraterrestrial life and cosmology. Although this volume offers a single source for comprehensive space flight information, its added value may be limited, as many libraries likely already own biographical resources (such as Michael Cassutt''s Who''s Who in Space), space-mission histories (such as Tim Furniss''s The History of Space Vehicles), and science and technology references (such as the McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology). In addition, readers will find the cross references lacking. Many entries, such as "MECO," are entered under their acronym or initials, but there is no cross reference from the fun form, in this case "Main Engine Cut Off". In addition, entries for scientific terms are often inadequate. For example, "weightlessness" is a mere one paragraph, though one would expect much fuller treatment of such a major aspect of space flight.

Because of this, the majority of the text is devoted to careful derivations of implicit function theorems, methods of averaging, and quasi-static state approximation methods.  The duality between stability and perturbation is developed and used, relying heavily on the concept of stability under persistent disturbances.  This explains why stability and perturbation results developed for quite simple problems are often useful for more complicated, even chaotic, ones. Relevant topics about linear and nonlinear systems, nonlinear oscillations, and stability methods for difference, differential-delay, integro-differential and ordinary and partial differential equations are developed in the book.

He reminds us about the short-lived 1970s Skylab program, which was to have been followed by other U.S. space stations. Granted access to Russian archives and interviews with cosmonauts and their families, the author describes the Soviet program in great detail. The original Russian space stations, he reports, were intended primarily for propaganda and military purposes, but they also included a variety of scientific experiments and perfected the use of unmanned "freighters" to bring supplies and parts from Earth. If readers remember anything about the Russian program, it is probably the troubled final months of the Mir station, but Zimmerman describes the heroic efforts of cosmonauts to put out fires and make extended space walks to undertake complicated repairs. The Russians also conducted extensive research on the effects of living in space on the human body, research that will be invaluable for possible future travel to other planets.

In a ''black-box'' system, such faults only become   apparent in the output when appropriate inputs are given, which poses a   number of satisfaction and optimisation problems regarding both testing and   diagnosing. In this dissertation we address such problems, developing   models with multi-valued logics that we formalise and generalise to   multiple faults. Such logics extend Boolean logic by encoding dependencies   on faults, thus allowing the modelling of an arbitrary number of diagnostic   theories. The effectiveness of constraint solving over finite domains and   sets is shown on several of the above problems.', 2002, 'English', 'IOS Press', 210, '1000/c115d4dd8b2f9a364f535dd8916894a6.jpg');

Beginners lack the expertise required to understand highly specialized treatments of individual topics. This is especially problematic for a field as broad as electromagnetics, which propagates into many diverse engineering fields. The time has come to find a middle ground.  The Handbook of Engineering Electromagnetics links theory to specific applications with an integrated approach to areas such as wireless communications, fiber optics, microwaves, radar, materials science, and even biomedical engineering. This book not only provides the necessary formulas, figures, and tables, but also the underlying theory and insight needed to formulate and solve real-world engineering problems. A team of international experts discusses fundamental concepts such as Maxwell equations, static fields, electromagnetic induction, transmission lines, waveguides, and electromagnetic compatibility. They also explore specific technologies, various numerical techniques used for computer-aided solutions, biological effects and safety standards, biomedical applications, and measuring electromagnetic properties of biological materials.  With tables and graphs integrated into the discussion, each chapter is a nearly self-contained oasis of practical and theoretical problem-solving information for individual applications, with references directing you to more in-depth information.

The Fields of Electronics: Understanding Electronics Using Basic Physics offers a highly original correction to this state of affairs.

Electromagnetic field theory is an important part of basic physics, but because it is a very mathematical subject, the connection to everyday problems is not emphasized.

Taguchi’s optimization method is developed based on the orthogonal array (OA) concept, which offers a systematic and efficient way to select design parameters. The book illustrates the basic implementation procedure of Taguchi’s optimization method and discusses various advanced techniques for performance improvement. In addition, the integration of Taguchi’s optimization method with commercial electromagnetics software is introduced in the book. The proposed optimization method is used in various linear antenna arrays, microstrip filters, and ultra-wideband antenna designs. Successful examples include linear antenna array with a null controlled pattern, linear antenna array with a sector beam, linear antenna array with reduced side lobe levels, microstrip band stop filter, microstrip band pass filter, coplanar waveguide band stop filter, coplanar ultra-wide band antenna, and ultra-wide band antenna with band notch feature.

In this dramatic and moving biography, Sylvia Nasar re-creates the life of a mathematical genius whose brilliant career was cut short by schizophrenia and who, after three decades of devastating mental illness, miraculously recovered and was honored with a Nobel Prize. A Beautiful Mind traces the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash, Jr., from his lonely childhood in West Virginia to his student years at Princeton, where he encountered Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, and a host of other mathematical luminaries. At twenty-one, the handsome, ambitious, eccentric graduate student invented what would become the most influential theory of rational human behavior in modern social science. Nash''s contribution to game theory would ultimately revolutionize the field of economics. As a young professor at MIT, still in his twenties, Nash dazzled the mathematical world by solving a series of deep problems deemed "impossible" by other mathematicians. As unconventional in his private life as in his mathematics, Nash fathered a child with a woman he did not marry. At the height of the McCarthy era, he was expelled as a security risk from the supersecret RAND Corporation -- the Cold War think tank where he was a consultant. At thirty, Nash was poised to take his dreamed-of place in the pantheon of history''s greatest mathematicians. His associates included the most renowned mathematicians and economists of the era: Norbert Wiener, John Milnor, Alexandre Grothendieck, Kenneth Arrow, Robert Solow, and Paul Samuelson. He married an exotic and beautiful MIT physics student, Alicia Larde. They had a son. Then Nash suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown. Nasar details Nash''s harrowing descent into insanity -- his bizarre delusions that he was the Prince of Peace; his resignation from MIT, flight to Europe, and attempt to renounce his American citizenship; his repeated hospitalizations, from the storied McLean, where he came to know the poet Robert Lowell, to t', 2000, 'English', '', 127, '882000/9f74302335b5049d4c6a02900c1532b0-g.jpg');

There are many reasons why it should be written. First, the theory of transversely isotropic elastic materials is an important branch of applied mathematics and engineering science; but because of the difficulties caused by anisotropy, the mathematical treatments and descriptions of individual problems have been scattered throughout the technical literature. This often hinders further development and applications. Hence, a text that can present the theory and solution methodology uniformly is necessary. Secondly, with the rapid development of modern technologies, the theory of transversely isotropic elasticity has become increasingly important. In addition to the fields with which the theory has traditionally been associated, such as civil engineering and materials engineering, many emerging technologies have demanded the development of transversely isotropic elasticity. Some immediate examples are thin film technology, piezoelectric technology, functionally gradient materials technology and those involving transversely isotropic and layered microstructures, such as multi-layer systems and tribology mechanics of magnetic recording devices. Thus a unified mathematical treatment and presentation of solution methods for a wide range of mechanics models are of primary importance to both technological and economic progress.</p>', 2006, 'English', 'Springer Netherlands', 435, '2000/2A77DDC881ACACDBEEE860F288CE6A68-d.jpg');

Doyle', 'All structures suffer from stresses and strains caused by factors such as wind loading and vibrations. Stress analysis and measurement is an integral part of the design and management of structures, and is used in a wide range of engineering areas. There are two main types of stress analyses - the first is conceptual where the structure does not yet exist and the analyst has more freedom to define geometry, materials, loads etc - generally such analysis is undertaken using numerical methods such as the finite element method. The second is where the structure (or a prototype) exists, and so some parameters are known. Others though, such as wind loading or environmental conditions will not be completely known and yet may profoundly affect the structure. These problems are generally handled by an ad hoc combination of experimental and analytical methods. This book therefore tackles one of the most common challenges facing engineers - how to solve a stress analysis problem when all of the required information is not available. Its central concern is to establish formal methods for including measurements as part of the complete analysis of such problems by presenting a new approach to the processing of experimental data and thus to experimentation itself. In addition, engineers using finite element methods will be able to extend the range of problems they can solve (and thereby the range of applications they can address) using the methods developed here.', 2004, 'English', 'Wiley', 435, '2000/0a8f1a16266f5a71be1b166eda5901eb-d.jpg');

It is expedient, to make thin­ walled composite rods, plates, and shells from such materials. Plates can be made by bonding a set of unidirectional thin fiber layers, Fig.l.l. Such plates are orthotropic, as a rule. A random short-fiber composite is shown in Fig. 1.2. Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used in thin-walled aircraft structures because of their specific high strength. For example, the graphite-epoxy composite is characterized by a unidirectional tensile strength of 1.4 GPa while the density is 1.6 Mg/rrt? . For comparison, we may take a steel (steel 4340) whose corresponding properties are identified by values like 1.2 GPa and 7.8 Mg/rrt? . 1. INTRODUCTION Figure 1.1 2 1.1.

For the first 25 years or so of its existence, information theory served as a rich source of academic research problems and as a tantalizing suggestion that communication systems could be made more efficient and more reliable by using these approaches. Other than small experiments and a few highly specialized military systems, the theory had little interaction with practice. By the mid 1970’s, however, mainstream systems using information-theoretic ideas began to be widely implemented. The first reason for this was the increasing number of engineers who understood both information theory and communication system practice. The second reason was that the low cost and increasing processing power of digital hardware made it possible to implement the sophisticated algorithms suggested by information theory. The third reason was that the increasing complexity of communication systems required the architectural principles of information theory.', 1985, 'English', 'Elsevier Science Ltd', 286, '2000/c2d2da86570bbfa765f53ba7ee133a85.jpg');

Their shrinking size and increasing complexity make  computer simulation an important tool to design better devices that meet  ever rising perfomance requirements. The current need to apply advanced design software in optoelectronics follows the trend observed in the 1980''s with simulation software for silicon devices.  Today, software for technology computer-aided design (TCAD) and electronic design automation (EDA) represents a fundamental part of the silicon industry. In optoelectronics, advanced commercial device software has emerged recently and it is expected to play an increasingly important role in the near future. This book will enable students, device engineers, and researchers to more effectively use advanced design software in optoelectronics.                                         *  Provides fundamental knowledge in semiconductor physics and in electromagnetics, while helping to understand and use advanced device simulation software  *  Demonstrates the combination of measurements and simulations in order to obtain realistic results and provides data on all required material parameters  *  Gives deep insight into the physics of state-of-the-art devices and helps to design and analyze of modern optoelectronic devices', 2003, 'English', 'Academic Press', 296, '2000/f4c3ef22e9b1d8edb031ead05d8f3dcd-d.jpg');

Marchenkova', 'This volume is the first to explore links between the Russian linguist Mikhail Bakhtin''s theoretical insights about language and practical concerns with second and foreign language learning and teaching. Situated within a strong conceptual framework and drawing from a rich empirical base, it reflects recent scholarship in applied linguistics that has begun to move away from formalist views of language as universal, autonomous linguistic systems, and toward an understanding of language as dynamic collections of cultural resources. According to Bakhtin, the study of language is concerned with the  dialogue  existing between linguistic elements and the uses to which they are put in response to the conditions of the moment. Such a view of language has significant implications for current understandings of second- and foreign-language learning.  The contributors draw on some of Bakhtin''s more significant concepts, such as dialogue, utterance, heteroglossia, voice, and addressivity to examine real world contexts of language learning. The chapters address a range of contexts including elementary- and university-level English as a second language and foreign language classrooms and adult learning situations outside the formal classroom. The text is arranged in two parts. Part I, "Contexts of Language Learning and Teaching," contains seven chapters that report on investigations into specific contexts of language learning and teaching. The chapters in Part II, "Implications for Theory and Practice," present broader discussions on second and foreign language learning using Bakhtin''s ideas as a springboard for thinking.  This is a groundbreaking volume for scholars in applied linguistics, language education, and language studies with an interest in second and foreign language learning; for teacher educators; and for teachers of languages from elementary to university levels. It is highly relevant as a text for graduate-level courses in applied linguistics and second- and foreign-language education.', 2005, 'English', 'L.

It is thoroughly researched, highly objective, absolutely accurate, and includes just about every essential term, abbreviation, acronym, contraction, initialism, and portmanteau you might encounter in the telecom and datacom domains. Although the book is a technical dictionary, Horak’s plain-English, commonsense style yields definitions that are as thoroughly understandable to the business professional or student as they are to the electrical engineer. In fact, many entries are encyclopedic in nature, discussing applications and issues. Horak also injects a bit of his wry sense of humor, sprinkling occasional telecom trivia and marginally related definitions that will have you smiling and chuckling to yourself, but not to the point that they detract from what is an important book on a serious subject. An instant classic, Webster’s New World Telecom Dictionary is the one and only telecom dictionary you will need. It also makes a perfect companion to Horak’s Telecommunications and Data Communications Handbook, published by Wiley-Interscience in October 2007.', 2007, 'English', 'Webster''s New World', 591, '2000/9b09122a7ab1baced415357172d1afa9-d.jpg');

It considers presentations made to persuade an audience to adopt some course of action (such as funding a proposal) as well as presentations made to communicate information, and it considers these from four perspectives: speech, structure, visual aids, and delivery. In keeping with technological innovations, it discusses computer-based projections and slide shows as well as overhead projections. In particular, it discusses ways of organizing graphics and text in projected images and of using layout and design to present the information efficiently and effectively.Unlike other books that discuss technical presentations, this book anchors its advice in the experiences of scientists and engineers, including such successful presenters as Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, as well as currently active laboratory directors, scientists, and engineers. In addition to examining successful presentations, Alley also discusses the errors that cause many scientific presentations to flounder, providing a list of ten critical errors to avoid.

Some of the leading issues in today''s political marketplace - embryonic stem cell research, global warming, health care reform, space exploration, genetic privacy, germ warfare - are informed by scientific ideas. Never has it been more crucial for the lay public to be scientifically literate. That''s where science writers come in. And that''s why it''s time for an update to the Field Guide, already a staple of science writing graduate programs across the country. The academic community has recently recognized how important it  is for writers to become more sophisticated, knowledgeable, and skeptical about what the write. More than 50 institutions now offer training in science writing. In addition mid-career fellowships for science writers are growing, giving journalists the chance to return to major universities for specialized training. We applaud these developments, and hope to be part of them with this new edition of the Field Guide. In A Field Guide for Science Writers, 2nd Edition, the editors have assembled contributions from a collections of experinced journalists who are every bit as stellar as the group that contributed to the first edition. In the end, what we have are essays written by the very best in the science writing profession. These wonderful writers have written not only about style, but about content, too. These leaders in the profession describe how they work their way through the information glut to find the gems worth writing about.

Birch', 'This book is a comprehensive, myth-debunking examination of how L1 features (orthographic system, phonology, morphology) can influence English L2 reading at the "bottom" of the reading process. It provides a thorough but very accessible linguistic/psycholinguistic examination of the lowest levels of the reading process. It is both theoretical and practical.Although the methodologies and approaches taken in most ESL/EFL texts about reading are top-down (cognition driven), and pay scant attention to the bottom of the reading process, those detailed in this book are language driven. The goal is to balance or supplement (not replace) top-down approaches and methodologies with effective low-level options for teaching English reading. Core linguistic and psycholinguistic concepts are presented within the context of their application to teaching.English L2 Reading: Getting to the Bottom clearly explains the strategies that readers of other languages develop in response to their own writing systems (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, other alphabets, or transparent Roman alphabetic systems) contrasted with an explanation of the strategies that English readers develop in response to the opaque orthography of English, and explicates how other low-level processing strategies for L1 morphology and word formation may aid or hinder processing in English L2 reading acquisition.A complete, balanced reading ideology should be big enough to embrace all reading theories and practices.

It has become increasingly clear, however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes categories as distributions and views knowledge of language not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena, probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground. Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective.    This book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial on elementary probability theory and probabilistic grammars.', 2003, 'English', 'MIT Press', 464, '2000/6b5dd2de2ce943d56e14712b495ab266-d.jpg');

Chapters 1-6 present Chomsky''s early work on the nature and acquisition of language as a genetically endowed, biological system (Universal Grammar), through the rules and principles of which we acquire an internalized knowledge (I-language). Over the past fifty years, this framework has sparked an explosion of inquiry into a wide range of languages, and has yielded some major theoretical questions. The final chapter revisits the key issues, reviewing the ''biolinguistic'' approach that has guided Chomsky''s work from its origins to the present day, and raising some novel and exciting challenges for the study of language and mind.', 2006, 'English', 'Cambridge University Press', 209, '2000/99b5b9d0dab2cee5e8079f2a67b38ffa-d.jpg');

Culicover, Ray Jackendoff', 'This groundbreaking book offers a new and compelling perspective on the structure of human language. The fundamental issue it addresses is the proper balance between syntax and semantics, between structure and derivation, and between rule systems and lexicon. It argues that the balance struck by mainstream generative grammar is wrong. It puts forward a new basis for syntactic theory, drawing on a wide range of frameworks, and charts new directions for research.  In the past four decades, theories of syntactic structure have become more abstract, and syntactic derivations have become ever more complex. Peter Culicover and Ray Jackendoff trace this development through the history of contemporary syntactic theory, showing how much it has been driven by theory-internal rather than empirical considerations. They develop an alternative that is responsive to linguistic, cognitive, computational, and biological concerns.  Simpler Syntax is addressed to linguists of all persuasions.

This further implies that in their applied linguistics, applied linguists take account of a wider range of interests and disciplines than do linguists who are primarily concerned with the development and validation of linguistic theories.

The fundamental norms of discourse are formulated in terms of the conditions under which sentences are assertible in such contexts.

In attempting to present some of Montague''s insights in an elementary way (hopefully avoid­ ing the notation which many find difficult at first), the authors began dis­ cussions aimed towards the construction of a simple model-theoretical semantic apparatus which could be applied directly to a small English-like language and used to illustrate the methods of formal logical interpretation. In these discussions two points impressed themselves on us. First, our task could be simplified by using boolean algebras and boolean homomorphisms in the models; and second, the boolean approach we were developing had much more widespread relevance to the logical structure of English than we first thought. During the summer and fall of 1978 we continued work on the system, proving the more fundamental theorems (including what we have come to call the Justification Theorem) and outlining the way in which an intensional interpretation scheme could be developed which made use of the boolean approach (which was originally strictly extensional). We presented our findings in a monograph (Keenan and Faltz, 1978) which the UCLA Linguistics Department kindly published as part of their series called Occa­ sional Papers in Linguistics; one of the authors also presented the system at a colloquium held at the Winter Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America in December 1978.</p>', 1984, 'English', 'Springer Netherlands', 387, '2000/c25e29fd92fc67e4a03670191e0e2d38-d.jpg');

By working with natural classes and type submodules (TS), Classes of Modules develops the foundations and tools for the next generation of ring and module theory. It shows how to achieve positive results by placing restrictive hypotheses on a small subset of the complement submodules, Furthermore, it explains the existence of various direct sum decompositions merely as special cases of type direct sum decompositions.   Carefully developing the foundations of the subject, the authors begin by providing background on the terminology and introducing the different module classes. The modules classes consist of torsion, torsion-free, s[M], natural, and prenatural. They expand the discussion by exploring advanced theorems and new classes, such as new chain conditions, TS-module theory, and the lattice of prenatural classes of right R-modules, which contains many of the previously used lattices of module classes.

One of its first important problems was partially solved by Dushnik, Miller 1940 who, starting from the chain of reals, obtained an infinite strictly decreasing sequence of chains (of continuum power) with respect to embeddability.  In 1948 I conjectured that every strictly decreasing sequence of denumerable chains is finite.  This was affirmatively proved by Laver (1968), in the more general case of denumerable unions of scattered chains (ie: which do not embed the chain Q of rationals), by using the barrier and the better orderin gof Nash-Williams (1965 to 68).  Another important problem is the extension to posets of classical properties of chains.  For instance one easily sees that a chain A is scattered if the chain of inclusion of its initial intervals is itself scattered (6.1.4).  Let us again define a scattered poset A by the non-embedding of Q in A.  We say that A is finitely free if every antichain restriction of A is finite (antichain = set of mutually incomparable elements of the base). In 1969 Bonnet and Pouzet proved that a poset A is finitely free and scattered iff the ordering of inclusion of initial intervals of A is scattered.  In 1981 Pouzet proved the equivalence with the a priori stronger condition that A is topologically scattered: (see 6.7.4; a more general result is due to Mislove 1984); ie: every non-empty set of initial intervals contains an isolated elements for the simple convergence topology.

The answer is simple: I did not learn about it until it was too late! My writing project in ring theory started in 1983 after I taught a year-long course in the subject at Berkeley. My original plan was to write up my lectures and publish them as a graduate text in a couple of years. My hopes of carrying out this plan on schedule were, however, quickly dashed as I began to realize how much material was at hand and how little time I had at my disposal. As the years went by, I added further material to my notes, and used them to teach different versions of the course. Eventually, I came to the realization that writing a single volume would not fully accomplish my original goal of giving a comprehensive treatment of basic ring theory. At the suggestion of Ulrike Schmickler-Hirzebruch, then Mathematics Editor of Springer-Verlag, I completed the first part of my project and published the write­ up in 1991 as A First Course in Noncommutative Rings, GTM 131, hereafter referred to as First Course (or simply FC).</p>', 1999, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag New York', 557, '3000/26e3dcccddeabf8f526ed58e93d059d3-d.jpg');

This book is an outgrowth of my lectures in these two courses, and is intended for use by instructors and graduate students in a similar one-semester course in basic ring theory. Ring theory is a subject of central importance in algebra. Historically, some of the major discoveries in ring theory have helped shape the course of development of modern abstract algebra. Today, ring theory is a fer­ tile meeting ground for group theory (group rings), representation theory (modules), functional analysis (operator algebras), Lie theory (enveloping algebras), algebraic geometry (finitely generated algebras, differential op­ erators, invariant theory), arithmetic (orders, Brauer groups), universal algebra (varieties of rings), and homological algebra (cohomology of rings, projective modules, Grothendieck and higher K-groups). In view of these basic connections between ring theory and other branches of mathemat­ ics, it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that a course in ring theory is an indispensable part of the education for any fledgling algebraist.

Hensel discovered such an analogue in his theory of p-adic numbers. He recognized that power series expansions can serve to clarify properties of systems of congruences which frequently occur in the allied theories of algebraic numbers and algebraic functions. In his book Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen he stated in 1908 the famous Reducibility Lemma on which a major part of the work on valuations is based. Thus, a powerful tool, already known to Newton in the discussion of plane curves, became available to algebra proper.

Permutations can be decomposed into cycles, polynomials over a finite field into irreducible factors, mappings into connected components. In all of these examples, and in many more, there are strong similarities between the numbers of components of different sizes that are found in the decompositions of "typical" elements of large size. For instance, the total number of components grows logarithmically with the size of the element, and the size of the largest component is an appreciable fraction of the whole.    This book explains the similarities in asymptotic behavior as the result of two basic properties shared by the structures: the conditioning relation and the logarithmic condition. The discussion is conducted in the language of probability, enabling the theory to be developed under rather general and explicit conditions; for the finer conclusions, Stein''s method emerges as the key ingredient.

The second, on multiplicative number systems, demonstrates the challenge and reward of becoming reasonably comfortable with Dirichlet series.Book News, Inc.R, Portland, ORProduct Description:This book shows how a study of generating series (power series in the additive case and Dirichlet series in the multiplicative case), combined with structure theorems for the finite models of a sentence, lead to general and powerful results on limit laws, including $0 - 1$ laws. The book is unique in its approach to giving a combined treatment of topics from additive as well as from multiplicative number theory, in the setting of abstract number systems, emphasizing the remarkable parallels in the two subjects. Much evidence is collected to support the thesis that local results in additive systems lift to global results in multiplicative systems. All necessary material is given to understand thoroughly the method of Compton for proving logical limit laws, including a full treatment of Ehrenfeucht-Fraissé games, the Feferman-Vaught Theorem, and Skolem''s quantifier elimination for finite Boolean algebras.

The fact is that graph theory serves as a mathematical model for any system involving a binary relation.

Combinatorics is one of the branches of mathematics that play a crucial role in computer sCience, since digital computers manipulate discrete, finite objects. Combinatorics impinges on computing in two ways. First, the properties of graphs and other combinatorial objects lead directly to algorithms for solving graph-theoretic problems, which have widespread application in non-numerical as well as in numerical computing. Second, combinatorial methods provide many analytical tools that can be used for determining the worst-case and expected performance of computer algorithms. A knowledge of combinatorics will serve the computer scientist well. Combinatorics can be classified into three types: enumerative, eXistential, and constructive. Enumerative combinatorics deals with the counting of combinatorial objects.

This collection of Kolchin''s clear and comprehensive papers--in themselves constituting a history of the subject--is an invaluable aid to the student of differential algebra. In 1910, Ritt created a theory of algebraic differential equations modeled not on the existing transcendental methods of Lie, but rather on the new algebra being developed by E. Noether and B. van der Waerden. Building on Ritt''s foundation, and deeply influenced by Weil and Chevalley, Kolchin opened up Ritt theory to modern algebraic geometry. In so doing, he led differential geometry in a new direction. By creating differential algebraic geometry and the theory of differential algebraic groups, Kolchin provided the foundation for a ``new geometry'''' that has led to both a striking and an original approach to arithmetic algebraic geometry. Intriguing possibilities were introduced for a new language for nonlinear differential equations theory. The volume includes commentary by A. Borel, M. Singer, and B. Poizat. Also Buium and Cassidy trace the development of Kolchin''s ideas, from his important early work on the differential Galois theory to his later groundbreaking results on the theory of differential algebraic geometry and differential algebraic groups.

Goldschmidt, P. A. Griffiths (auth.)', '<p>This book gives a treatment of exterior differential systems. It will in­ clude both the general theory and various applications. An exterior differential system is a system of equations on a manifold defined by equating to zero a number of exterior differential forms. When all the forms are linear, it is called a pfaffian system. Our object is to study its integral manifolds, i. e. , submanifolds satisfying all the equations of the system. A fundamental fact is that every equation implies the one obtained by exterior differentiation, so that the complete set of equations associated to an exterior differential system constitutes a differential ideal in the algebra of all smooth forms. Thus the theory is coordinate-free and computations typically have an algebraic character; however, even when coordinates are used in intermediate steps, the use of exterior algebra helps to efficiently guide the computations, and as a consequence the treatment adapts well to geometrical and physical problems. A system of partial differential equations, with any number of inde­ pendent and dependent variables and involving partial derivatives of any order, can be written as an exterior differential system.

In much the same way that ordinary Galois theory is the theory of field extensions generated by solutions of (one variable) polynomial equations, differential Galois theory looks at the nature of the differential field extension generated by the solutions of differential equations. An additional feature is that the corresponding differential Galois groups (of automorphisms of the extension fixing the base and commuting with the derivation) are algebraic groups. This book deals with the differential Galois theory of linear homogeneous differential equations, whose differential Galois groups are algebraic matrix groups. In addition to providing a convenient path to Galois theory, this approach also leads to the constructive solution of the inverse problem of differential Galois theory for various classes of algebraic groups.

Morales Ruiz', 'This book is devoted to the relation between two different concepts of integrability: the complete integrability of complex analytical Hamiltonian systems and the integrability of complex analytical linear differential equations. For linear differential equations, integrability is made precise within the framework of differential Galois theory. The connection of these two integrability notions is given by the variational equation (i.e. linearized equation) along a particular integral curve of the Hamiltonian system. The underlying heuristic idea, which motivated the main results presented in this monograph, is that a necessary condition for the integrability of a Hamiltonian system is the integrability of the variational equation along any of its particular integral curves. This idea led to the algebraic non-integrability criteria for Hamiltonian systems. These criteria can be considered as generalizations of classical non-integrability results by Poincaré and Liapunov, as well as more recent results by Ziglin and Yoshida. Thus, by means of the differential Galois theory it is not only possible to understand all these approaches in a unified way but also to improve them. Several important applications are also included: homogeneous potentials, Bianchi IX cosmological model, three-body problem, Hénon-Heiles system, etc.The book is based on the original joint research of the author with J.M. Peris, J.P. Ramis and C. Simó, but an effort was made to present these achievements in their logical order rather than their historical one.

A logarithmic point of view is taken, marking the exceptional divisor of each blowing-up and by considering only the vector fields which are tangent to this divisor, instead of the whole tangent sheaf. The first part of the book is devoted to the logarithmic background and to the permissible blowing-ups. The main part corresponds to the control of the algorithms for the desingularization strategies by means of numerical invariants inspired by Hironaka''s characteristic polygon. Only basic knowledge of local algebra and algebraic geometry is assumed of the reader.

It became increasingly important that vertex algebras are useful not only in the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, where they are by now ubiquitous, but also in other fields, such as algebraic geometry, theory of finite groups, modular functions, and topology. This book is an introduction to the theory of vertex algebras with a particular emphasis on the relationship between vertex algebras and the geometry of moduli spaces of algebraic curves. The authors make the first steps toward reformulating the theory of vertex algebras in a way that is suitable for algebraic-geometric applications. The notion of a vertex algebra is introduced in the book in a co-ordinate independent way, allowing the authors to give global geometric meaning to vertex operators on arbitrary smooth algebraic curves, possibly equipped with some additional data. To each vertex algebra and a smooth curve, they attach an invariant called the space of conformal blocks.  When the complex structure of the curve and other geometric data are varied, these spaces combine into a sheaf on the relevant moduli space. From this perspective, vertex algebras appear as the algebraic objects that encode the geometric structure of various moduli spaces associated with algebraic curves. Numerous examples and applications of vertex algebras are included, such as the Wakimoto realization of affine Kac-Moody algebras, integral solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, classical and quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions, and the $W$-algebras. The authors also establish a connection between vertex algebras and chiral algebras, introduced by A. Beilinson and V.

Similarly, ruled and elliptic surfaces are discussed in detail, and then the geometry of vector bundles over such surfaces is analyzed.

After discussing the theory of Radon transforms and Fourier transforms on symmetric spaces, inversion formulas, and range theorems, Helgason examines applications to invariant differential equations on symmetric spaces, existence theorems, and explicit solution formulas, particularly potential theory and wave equations. The canonical multitemporal wave equation on a symmetric space is included. The book concludes with a chapter on eigenspace representations--that is, representations on solution spaces of invariant differential equations. Known for his high-quality expositions, Helgason received the 1988 Steele Prize for his earlier books Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces and Groups and Geometric Analysis. Containing exercises (with solutions) and references to further results, this revised edition would be suitable for advanced graduate courses in modern integral geometry, analysis on Lie groups, and representation theory of Lie groups.', 1989, 'English', 'American Mathematical Society', 229, '3000/65532c3087b4cb3446bfe75d30eedbb5-d.jpg');

The simplest and most interesting of these is the moment polytope, a convex polyhedron which sits inside the dual of the Lie algebra of G. One of the main goals of this monograph is to describe what kinds of geometric information are encoded in this polytope. The moment polytope also encodes quantum information about the action of G. Using the methods of geometric quantization, one can frequently convert this action into a representation, p, of G on a Hilbert space, and in some sense the moment polytope is a diagramatic picture of the irreducible representations of G which occur as subrepresentations of p. Precise versions of this item of folklore are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Also, midway through Chapter 2 a more complicated object is discussed: the Duistermaat-Heckman measure, and the author explains in Chapter 4 how one can read off from this measure the approximate multiplicities with which the irreducible representations of G occur in p. The last two chapters of this book are a self-contained and somewhat unorthodox treatment of the theory of toric varieties in which the usual hierarchal relation of complex to symplectic is reversed.

Algebraic geometry has developed tremendously over the last century. During the 19th century, the subject was practiced on a relatively concrete, down-to-earth level; the main objects of study were projective varieties, and the techniques for the most part were grounded in geometric constructions. This approach flourished during the middle of the century and reached its culmination in the work of the Italian school around the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Ultimately, the subject was pushed beyond the limits of its foundations: by the end of its period the Italian school had progressed to the point where the language and techniques of the subject could no longer serve to express or carry out the ideas of its best practitioners.</p>', 1992, 'English', 'Springer-Verlag New York', 330, '3000/2f05b33ef0425d3ea8fe60c0502d28a8-d.jpg');
